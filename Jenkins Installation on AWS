Set Up a Jenkins Build Server

Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of AWS Services, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot, 
and Amazon EC2 Fleet. You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS in 
a matter of minutes

This will walk you through 4 steps:
1) Set up Pre-requisites
To prepare for this tutorial, you will need an AWS account, an AWS Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) user name and password, an Amazon EC2 key pair, 
and a configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

2) Launch an EC2 instance after creating security group that has http allowed from anywhere as inbound rule:
Add SSH , http, ICMP IPv4 with anywhere option and launch an instance.

3) Install Jenkins
Use putty to connect to the created instance by using username and public dns name of the instance by adding the key under Connections>SSH>Auth

Connecting using ssh:
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
and say yes when it asks to confirm the authenticity of the connection

For linux: installation
- yum install java-1.8* -y
- java --version
- find / -name java
find out for the java where it has /bin
vi .bash_profile
     JAVA_HOME= /*.....*/
     PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
  :wq
- Open in another session
- switch as root user: sudo su -
- echo $PATH /*This shoudl show java instlled path*/
sudo su/bash --for getting root access
yum update -y -- To update software packages
1) sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo  -- To add the jenkins repo
2) Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package- 
     sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key  
3) Install Jenkins: yum install jenkins -y
4) Start Jenkins:   service jenkins start
5) use http://publicDNSname:8080 to access the first Admin login page
6) Get the password from the path mentioned on the page
 /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
7) It will ask us to install plugins - Choose suggested plugins
8) Add jenkins users other than Admin and then it is ready to use.
9) Click on Manage Jenkins ? Manage plugins> Available Tab and search for Amazon EC2 plugin and install it without restart.
10) Be sure to clean up after you are done with the AWS VM usage
